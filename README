Simple Cone Search - source repository

This ivoatex SCS source repo was started out of the HTML version of
REC-SCS-1.03-20080222.html (that for this reason is preserved in this
source bundle).

Initial porting, whose goal was to bring the specification to revision
1.1  has been a plain transposition of the HTML into LaTeX, and includes
all of the history changes that the original document listed in appendix.
Porting tried to be as faithful as possible, given broken links and
references, styling issues and so. However the goal was not to produce
as one-to-one ivoatex SCS-1.03, but to form a basis to start the
revision from.
